Problem in a sentence
The number of RCT papers released is continuing to increase, those without structured abstracts can be hard to read and in turn slow down researchers moving through the literature
Solution
Make an NLP model that categorizes abstract statements according to the function they serve (such as objective, techniques, findings, etc.), so that researchers may quickly scan the literature and delve further as needed.

Dataset
Worked on PubMed RCT20k dataset
