# SKIMLIT and pytorch vision tranformer
Problem in a sentence
The number of RCT papers released is continuing to increase, those without structured abstracts can be hard to read and in turn slow down researchers moving through the literature
Solution
Make an NLP model that categorizes abstract statements according to the function they serve (such as objective, techniques, findings, etc.), so that researchers may quickly scan the literature and delve further as needed.

Dataset
Worked on PubMed RCT20k dataset

In our endeavor to bridge the gap between natural language processing and computer vision, we're diving deep into replicating the "Vision Transformer (ViT)" using PyTorch, as introduced in the paper "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale". We will dissect and implement the original ViT architecture and apply it to the "FoodVision Mini" dataset, a curated collection of diverse food images. This project aims to showcase the transformative potential of the ViT model in recognizing and categorizing food items, emphasizing the adaptability and prowess of transformer architectures beyond textual data.
